# LZip

GZip but from Luke not GNU

---

This is an extremly naive implementation of the GZip decompression algorithm written in good old C.

## Build and install
1) `mkdir build ; cd build`
2) `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ..`
3) `sudo make`

This will put the executable `lzip` into `build/bin`
